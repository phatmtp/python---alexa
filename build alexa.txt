<1@> speech_recognition

The "speech_recognition" library is used to convert human speech into text. "sr" is actually an abbreviation for "speech_recognition". 

The SpeechRecognition package is a Python library that provides a unified interface to several speech recognition APIs, including Google Cloud Speech, Microsoft Azure Speech, IBM Watson Speech to Text, and Wit.ai. It can be used for both online and offline speech recognition.

This code will listen for speech and then use the Google Cloud Speech API to recognize the speech. The recognized text will then be printed to the console.

Once you have imported the package, you can create a recognizer object by calling the Recognizer() function. The recognizer object has several methods that you can use to perform speech recognition, such as:

- listen(): This method listens for speech and returns the recognized text.
- record(): This method records audio and returns the audio data.
- recognize_google(): This method uses the Google Cloud Speech API to recognize speech.
- recognize_sphinx(): This method uses the CMU Sphinx speech recognition engine to recognize speed

<2@> can speech_recognition be used as offline mode ?

the SpeechRecognition package can be used in offline mode. To do this, you need to install a speech recognition engine that supports offline mode. There are several speech recognition engines that support offline mode, including:

CMU Sphinx
Pocketsphinx
Kaldi

Once you have installed a speech recognition engine, you can use the recognize_sphinx() or recognize_pocketsphinx() methods of the SpeechRecognition package to recognize speech in offline mode.

The accuracy of offline speech recognition is often lower than online speech recognition, since the speech recognition engine does not have access to the latest data from the cloud. However, offline speech recognition can be useful in situations where there is no internet connection.

<3@> pyttsx3 

pyttsx3 is a Python library that provides text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. It is a cross-platform library that supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. pyttsx3 is a wrapper for several text-to-speech engines, including Microsoft Speech API (SAPI5), Apple's NSSpeechSynthesizer, and eSpeak.

pyttsx3 is easy to use and provides a simple interface for controlling speech output, including pitch, volume, and rate. It also allows you to customize the voice used for speech, such as the gender, age, and accent.

pyttsx3 is a popular library for creating TTS applications, such as screen readers, voice assistants, and educational software. It can also be used to add speech output to other applications, such as games and websites.

<4@> can pyttsx3 be used as offline mode?

pyttsx3 can be used in offline mode. To do this, you need to install a text-to-speech engine that supports offline mode. There are several text-to-speech engines that support offline mode, including:

eSpeak
MaryTTS
Festival

Once you have installed a text-to-speech engine, you can use the pyttsx3 library to control it in offline mode.

<5@> PyWhatKit

PyWhatKit is a Python library that can be used to automate tasks on WhatsApp and YouTube. It is a free and open-source library that is easy to use.

PyWhatKit can be used to do the following:

Send WhatsApp messages at a specific time.
Send WhatsApp messages to a group.

<6@> datetime package in python

The datetime package in Python provides a comprehensive suite of classes and functions for working with dates and times. It is a built-in package, so you do not need to install it separately.

The most important class in the datetime package is the datetime class. This class represents a specific point in time, such as "2023-08-18 14:54:22". You can create a datetime object by passing the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second as arguments to the constructor.

<7@> wikipedia package in python

The Wikipedia package in Python is a library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia. It wraps the MediaWiki API so you can focus on using Wikipedia data, not getting it.

<8@> pyjokes package in python

The pyjokes package in Python is a library that makes it easy to get jokes. It provides a number of methods for getting jokes, including:

get_joke(): This method gets a random joke.
get_category_joke(): This method gets a joke from a specific category.
get_custom_joke(): This method gets a joke based on a custom prompt.

<9@> what is NLTK libary ?

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a widely used open-source library for working with human language data in Python. It provides a wide range of tools and resources for natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics tasks.

Some key features and functionalities of the NLTK library include:

1. Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words or sentences.

2. Part-of-speech tagging: Assigning grammatical tags to each word in a sentence (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).

3. Named entity recognition: Identifying named entities such as persons, organizations, and locations in text.

4. Stemming and lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run").

5. Sentiment analysis: Assessing the emotional tone of text (positive, negative, neutral).

6. WordNet integration: Access to WordNet, a lexical database with groups of synonymous words and their interrelationships.

7. Chunking and parsing: Structuring and analyzing syntactic components of sentences.

8. Machine learning algorithms: NLTK provides tools for training and using machine learning models on text data.

NLTK is widely used in research, education, and industry applications for tasks such as text classification, information extraction, sentiment analysis, language modeling, and more. It includes corpora (large and structured collections of text) and resources for various languages, making it a valuable resource for natural language processing tasks in Python.

<10@> nltk.download('punkt')

The "punkt" is a library that is being downloaded in this code snippet. It's a library that is being used for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. 

POS tagging is a way to classify words in a sentence into different categories, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. 

Knowing the Part-of-Speech classification of words can be useful for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more. 

NLTK comes with default POS tagging libraries, but it can also download and utilize third-party libraries, such as "punkt" in this case.

Punkt" is a library that is being used for Part-of-Speech (POS). It's a third-party library that is being downloaded and used to improve the effectiveness of the POS tagging functionality.

POS stands for "Part-of-Speech", and POS tagging is a part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLTK is a library that offers a range of NLP functionality, including Part-of-Speech tagging. 

So, POS tagging is a subset of NLP, and "Punkt" is a library that is being used to improve the POS tagging functionality of the "nltk" library in this code snippet.

<11@> nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

"averaged_perceptron_tagger" is a library that is used for the task of Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. POS tagging is a way to classify words in a sentence into different categories, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. 

The "averaged_perceptron_tagger" library is being used to improve the accuracy and performance of POS tagging.

<12@> pos_tags = nltk.pos_tag(tokens)

"pos_tag" is a function in the NLTK library that is used for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.

"pos_tag" is a short form for "Part-of-Speech tagger". POS tagging is a way to classify words in a sentence into different categories, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc. 

The "nltk.pos_tag" function is being used to tag the words in the command that was provided to the AI system, in this case, "What's the weather like today?".

<13@> API key for the OpenWeatherMap API

To obtain the correct API key for the OpenWeatherMap API, you will need to create an account on the OpenWeatherMap website and generate an API key. Here's how you can do it:

- Go to the OpenWeatherMap website (https://openweathermap.org/) and click on the "Sign up" button.
- Fill in your details and create an account.
- Once you are logged in, go to the API Keys section of your account.
- Click on the "Generate" button to generate a new API key.
- Copy the API key that is generated for you.

Now, you can replace the 'your_api_key' placeholder in the code with the API key you obtained. Additionally, you can also provide the actual city name for the city variable to get the weather data for a specific location.

# Define the API key and base URL for OpenWeatherMap
api_key = 'your_api_key'
base_url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?'

# Store the user's city
city = 'London'

# Build the complete URL with parameters
complete_url = base_url + 'q=' + city + '&appid=' + api_key


<14@> with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")

In Python, 'with' is a keyword used to define a context manager that automatically manages resources being used. 

In this example, the microphone is being used as a source for audio and by using the 'with' keyword, we are making sure that the Microphone object is closed automatically, even if an error occurs during speech recognition, preventing any memory leak or other issues.

By using context managers, we can ensure that resources are closed and freed, even if an exception is raised, without having to worry about closing them manually.

<15@> r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)

The 'r' variable represents the 'Recognizer' object that we initialized earlier in the code. 

We use this object to adjust for ambient noise while listening to the user's voice using the microphone. 

By using the 'adjust_for_ambient_noise' method, the Recognizer instance is able to filter out any background noise and focus on the user's voice. 

This helps to improve the accuracy of the speech recognition process, making it easier for Alexa to understand and respond accurately to commands.

<16@> what is 'try' & 'except' ?

The try and except statements in Python are used to handle exceptions. An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. 

The try statement allows you to execute a block of code and catch any exceptions that occur. The except statement allows you to handle the exceptions that are caught.
 
'try' is a keyword in Python that allows you to create a block of code that will be executed while trying to avoid any errors that could occur.

In this case, we are using 'try' to contain the code for speech recognition.

By using 'try' and 'except', we are able to capture any errors that may occur during speech recognition and handle them appropriately. 

This prevents the program from crashing and ensures that it continues to run successfully. 

<17@> what is 'recognize_google(audio)' ?

'recognize_google(audio)' is a method of the Recognizer object 'r' that we have created earlier in the code. 

This method is used to call the Google Speech Recognition API to recognize the user's speech. 

This method requires an 'audio' argument, which in this code snippet is being provided by the 'sr.Microphone() as source' object.

<18@> what is 'UnknownValueError' ?

An 'sr.UnknownValueError' exception is raised when the Recognizer object 'r' is unable to recognize the user's speech. 

This is typically caused due to a speech recognition error or other issues that prevent the Recognizer from correctly recognizing the words that are being spoken by the user.

When this error occurs, the message 'Sorry, I didn't catch that.' is printed to the console by Alexa.

<19@> what is 'RequestError ' ?

An 'sr.RequestError' exception is raised when the Recognizer object 'r' is unable to successfully call the Google Speech Recognition API due to an internal error or other issues. 

This can occur due to network constraints or other issues that prevent the Recognizer to connect and communicate with the API, preventing the Recognizer from recognizing the user's speech correctly. 

When this error occurs, the message 'An error occurred during speech recognition: ' is printed to the console by Alexa.

<20@> print("An error occurred during speech recognition:", str(e))

In this code snippet, we are printing the 'e' error using the 'str' function to display it in a more understandable format. 

By using 'str(e)', we are effectively converting 'e' to a string and printing that string to the console, allowing us to display the error message in a more human-readable format. 

This is useful for debugging purposes, as it allows us to see exactly what the error message is and helps us understand why the error occurred during speech recognition.

<21@> audio = r.listen(source)

'r.listen(source)' is a method of the Recognizer object 'r'. 

This method is used to start listening to audio from the 'source' object, which in this case is the 'sr.Microphone() as source' object.

When this method is called, the Recognizer object 'r' will enter the 'listening' state, where it will start to listen for the user's speech and convert it to text using the Google Speech Recognition API.

<22@> engine = pyttsx3.init()

'engine = pyttsx3.init()' is used to initialize the 'pyttsx3' library.

This library is used to generate text-to-speech audio, which is used to make Alexa speak the weather information we retrieve from the OpenWeather API. 

By using this line of code, we are initializing the 'pyttsx3' library, making it ready for use later in the code.

<23@> engine.runAndWait()

'engine.runAndWait()' is a method used to run the text-to-speech engine that we have instantiated in the code.

When this method is called, the engine will start generating text-to-speech audio, using the text returned by the Recognizer object 'r' (which we previously converted to text using the Goople Speech Recognition API).

The phrase 'runAndWait' is used because the engine will not stop generating text-to-speech audio, even if the user stops the conversation with Alexa.

This method is useful for cases where we want to play out lengthy sound clips or audio

<24@> engine.setProperty('rate', 150) 		 		 
      engine.setProperty('volume', 0.8) 

'engine.setProperty('rate', 150)' and 'engine.setProperty('volume', 0.8) are methods used to set the speaking rate and volume of the text-to-speech engine.

By using these methods, we can specify how fast the engine should speak and how loud it should speak the text-to-speech audio.

The rates and volumes specified in this example (150 words per minute and 0.8 for the volume) are just the default values and you can modify them according to your needs.

<25@> import requests

The 'requests' library is a module in Python that is used to send HTTP requests to web APIs. 

This is useful for retrieving data from various online APIs, such as the OpenWeather API that we are using in this Alexa skill to retrieve weather information. 

The requests module makes it easy to send HTTP requests and retrieve API results, since it handles most of the low-level HTTP requests. 

As long as you know the API endpoint and any relevant parameters required, you can use the 'requests' library to retrieve API results

<26@> API key

An 'API key' is a unique identifier provided by an API provider that allows you to authenticate and access a specific API.

In the context of this project - OpenWeather API - there's a free API key that can be generated, where we make API calls, and retrieve data from the OpenWeather API.

In order to retrieve data from an OpenWeather API, we need to send the API key along with the request. In this project, we're using the 'api\_key' constant, which contains the API key provided by the OpenWeather API website.

<27@> URL

A URL is an abbreviation for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the address of a web page or other resource on the Internet.

<28@> complete_url = base_url + 'q=' + city + '&appid=' + api_key

The 'complete_url' is the final URL that we use when we make the request to the OpenWeather API, to retrieve the weather information.
 
By using the '&' symbol, we are passing additional parameters to the OpenWeather API, such as 'q=' (query, which is the city) and 'appid=' (application id, which is our API key).

By combining the base URL with the additional parameters, we get the complete URL that we will send to the OpenWeather API, and retrieve the weather information.

->
base_url = "https://api.example.com/weather?"
city = "Tokyo"
api_key = "12345"

complete_url = base_url + 'q=' + city + '&appid=' + api_key
print(complete_url)

<29@> data = response.json()
temperature = data['main']['temp']
description = data['weather'][0]['description']

'data = response.json()' is used to convert the result returned by the OpenWeather API into a JSON object, which is easier to work with in Python.

The 'temp' field contains the current weather condition (in this case, the temperature) and the 'description' field contains a detailed description of the current weather for the user's specified location.

We are assigning these fields to the 'temperature' and 'description' variables, respectively, allowing us to easily use them later in our code to report the current weather to the user.

'JSON' (pronounced 'Jason') stands for 'JavaScript Object Notation'. It is a text-based data interchange format popular for transferring data between a server and a client, which is the device receiving the data. 

JSON is commonly used to transfer data between various online platforms and APIs, where it allows data to be easily transferred and manipulated in a human-readable and machine-readable format.

JSON data is structured in the form of key-value pairs, which can be simple strings, numbers, lists, and so on, which can be nested and used to define complex structures.

The 'weather' array that we are retrieving from the OpenWeather API data contains multiple 'weather' objects.

By using '[0]' in the 'description' variable, we are specifically selecting the 'weather' object at index 0 in the array, which is the weather description for the user's specified location.

This allows us to avoid any other possible weather descriptions for other locations or other weather information that may be present in the array, ensuring that our device only returns the weather description for the user's current location.

<30@> what is NLP ?

Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that deals with the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and generate human language.

NLP is a challenging field because human language is complex and often ambiguous. There are many different ways to say the same thing, and the meaning of a sentence can depend on the context in which it is used.

Despite the challenges, NLP has made significant progress in recent years. NLP techniques are now used in a wide variety of applications, including:

* **Machine translation:** NLP is used to translate text from one language to another.

* **Question answering:** NLP is used to answer questions posed in natural language.

* **Sentiment analysis:** NLP is used to determine the sentiment of a piece of text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.
* **Spam filtering:** NLP is used to filter out spam emails.

* **Chatbots:** NLP is used to create chatbots that can have conversations with humans.

* **Text summarization:** NLP is used to summarize text documents.

NLP is a rapidly growing field, and new applications are being developed all the time. As NLP technology continues to improve, it will have an increasingly profound impact on our lives.

Here are some of the common tasks in NLP:

* **Tokenization:** This is the process of breaking down a text into smaller units, such as words, phrases, or sentences.

* **Part-of-speech tagging:** This is the process of assigning a part-of-speech tag to each word in a text. For example, the word "dog" might be tagged as a noun, while the word "walked" might be tagged as a verb.

* **Named entity recognition:** This is the process of identifying named entities in a text, such as people, places, organizations, and dates.

* **Semantic analysis:** This is the process of determining the meaning of a text. This can be done by analyzing the words and phrases in the text, as well as the relationships between them.

* **Sentiment analysis:** This is the process of determining the sentiment of a text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

* **Machine translation:** This is the process of translating text from one language to another.

* **Question answering:** This is the process of answering questions posed in natural language.

* **Chatbots:** These are computer programs that can have conversations with humans. Chatbots are often powered by NLP technology.

NLP is a complex and challenging field, but it is also a very exciting one. As NLP technology continues to improve, it will have an increasingly profound impact on our lives.

<31@>     for command, response in commands.items():
        if command in text.lower():
            print("Assistant:", response)
            engine.say(response)
            engine.runAndWait()
            break
    else:
        print("Assistant: Sorry, I didn't understand.")


<32@> while True:
    	try:
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            print("Listening...")
            r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
            audio = r.listen(source)


This code snippet implements a simple command-processing logic in our code.

In this snippet, we are checking each input command that the user provides to the Alexa skill and, if the command matches one of our pre-programmed commands, we are printing the corresponding response to the user.

This allows us to provide natural language processing to our user and make the skill easier to use.

The 'response' variable in the code is used to store the response that is provided by the OpenWeather API and will be used to print the current weather information to the user.

'try' is a keyword in Python that is used to introduce a block of code that may potentially raise an error.

When this keyword is used, any errors that occur while the block of code is executing will be caught and handled appropriately, ensuring a smooth and error-free execution of the code.

As a result, using the 'try' keyword can significantly improve the reliability of your code and ensure that any unexpected surprises or issues are handled gracefully instead of crashing the program.

<33@> how to know the base url ?

The base URL is the part of a URL that remains the same for all pages on a website. It typically includes the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name, and the port number (if applicable).

There are a few ways to know the base URL of a website. One way is to look at the address bar of your web browser. The base URL will be everything up to the first forward slash (/).

For example, the base URL of the Google homepage is https://www.google.com/.

Another way to know the base URL of a website is to look at the HTML code of the page. The base URL will be the value of the href attribute of the <base> tag.

For example, the following HTML code shows the <base> tag for the Google homepage:

HTML

<base href="https://www.google.com/">

<34@> data = response.json()
  temperature = data['main']['temp']
  description = data['weather'][0]['description']
                                                                                                                                                          
how to know the 'main','temp' of json file. shall we click to it to find out ?   

The main and temp keys are part of the JSON response from the OpenWeatherMap API. The main key is an object that contains weather data, such as the temperature, humidity, and pressure. The temp key is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

To know the main and temp keys of a JSON file, you can use a JSON parser. A JSON parser is a tool that can read and parse JSON data. There are many JSON parsers available, both online and offline.

Once you have a JSON parser, you can use it to parse the JSON file. The parser will return an object that contains the data in the JSON file. You can then access the main and temp keys from the object.

For example, the following code snippet uses the Python JSON parser to parse the JSON file 

<35@> how to parse the JSON data from the OpenWeatherMap API 

->

import requests
import json

# Define the API key and base URL for OpenWeatherMap
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
base_url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?'

# Store user's city
city = 'London'

# Build the complete URL with parameters
complete_url = base_url + 'q=' + city + '&appid=' + api_key

# Send a GET request to the API
response = requests.get(complete_url)

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code == 200:
  # The request was successful, so parse the response
  data = response.json()

  # Print all the data in the JSON object
  for key, value in data.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

else:
  # The request was unsuccessful, so print an error message
  print(f"Error: {response.status_code}.")

To use this code, you will need to replace the `YOUR_API_KEY` placeholder with your own API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can get an API key for free from the OpenWeatherMap website.

Once you have replaced the API key, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then executing it in a Python interpreter. For example, you could run the code by typing the following command in a terminal:

->
python weather.py

This will print all the data in the JSON response from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The `data` variable will contain a dictionary of all the data in the JSON response. You can access the data by its key. For example, to get the temperature, you would do the following:

->
temperature = data['main']['temp']

The `temperature` variable will now contain the temperature in degrees Celsius.

You can also iterate over the `data` dictionary to print all the data. For example, the following code will print all the data in the JSON response:

-> 
  for key, value in data.items():
  print(f"{key}: {value}")


This code will print the key and value of each item in the dictionary.


2*** basic tutorial to build alexa

<1@> sets up a speech recognition system using the SpeechRecognition library. It listens to audio input from the microphone, adjusts for ambient noise, and then tries to recognize the speech using the Google Speech Recognition service. If successful, it prints out the recognized text.

# Initialize the recognizer (SpeechRecognition is required to build alexa)
# Use the microphone as the source for audio (microphone will be the source audio for alexa)
# Adjust for ambient noise (alexa can adjust ambient noice)
# Listen for audio and convert it to text (alexa can take the audio and convert to text)
# Recognize speech using Google Speech Recognition (alexa can recognize the text by using google)

<The basic code>

import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize the recognizer
r = sr.Recognizer()

# Use the microphone as the source for audio
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")

    # Adjust for ambient noise
    r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)

    # Listen for audio and convert it to text
    audio = r.listen(source)

    try:
        # Recognize speech using Google Speech Recognition
        text = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print("You said:", text)

    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I didn't catch that.")

    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print("An error occurred during speech recognition:", str(e))

<4@> Now, let's connect to APIs and services to enhance the functionality of your voice assistant. -> weather update

(You can integrate external APIs to fetch information such as weather updates, news headlines, or even play music from a streaming service).

# Define the API key and base URL for OpenWeatherMap
# Store user's city
# Build the complete URL with parameters
# Send a GET request to the API
# Parse the response to retrieve weather information
# Print the weather information

<The basic code>

import requests

# Define the API key and base URL for OpenWeatherMap
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
base_url = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?'

# Store user's city
city = 'London'

# Build the complete URL with parameters
complete_url = base_url + 'q=' + city + '&appid=' + api_key

# Send a GET request to the API
response = requests.get(complete_url)

# Parse the response to retrieve weather information
data = response.json()
temperature = data['main']['temp']
description = data['weather'][0]['description']

# Print the weather information
print(f"The current temperature in {city} is {temperature}°C.")
print(f"The weather is {description}.")

import requests

# Define the API key and base URL for OpenWeatherMap
api_key = '5c834ed52083cd22a60628fd5c7a51d1'
base_url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/'

# Store user's city
city = 'saigon'

# Build the complete URL with parameters
complete_url = f"{base_url}weather?q={city}&appid={api_key}"

# Send a GET request to the API
response = requests.get(complete_url)

# Parse the response to retrieve weather information
data = response.json()
temperature = data['main']['temp']
description = data['weather'][0]['description']

# Print the weather information
print(f"The current temperature in {city} is {temperature}°C.")
print(f"The weather is {description}.")


<5@> let's creating voice commands and generating appropriate responses in our voice assistant. The key is to design a framework that handles user commands effectively.

# Initialize the speech recognition and text-to-speech engines
# Define voice commands and responses
# Listen for user command
# Convert speech to text
# Process user command and generate response

<The basic code>

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3

# Initialize the speech recognition and text-to-speech engines
r = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Define voice commands and responses
commands = {
    'hello': 'Hello! How can I assist you?',
    'what is your name': 'My name is Assistant.',
    'how is the weather': 'Sorry, I am not connected to the internet.'
}

# Listen for user command
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")
    r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
    audio = r.listen(source)
    
    # Convert speech to text
    text = r.recognize_google(audio)
    print("User Command:", text)
    
    # Process user command and generate response
    for command, response in commands.items():
        if command in text.lower():
            print("Assistant:", response)
            engine.say(response)
            engine.runAndWait()
            break
    else:
        print("Assistant: Sorry, I didn't understand.")


<6@> Now, let's improve the user experience of your voice assistant by adding error handling and implementing additional features.

In this enhanced version, we added a while loop to continuously listen for user commands until the user says "stop",'hello',what is your name','how is the weather'.

You can further extend the functionality by implementing more sophisticated error handling techniques, incorporating machine learning models for intent recognition, or integrating additional APIs to provide more diverse responses.

# Initialize the speech recognition and text-to-speech engines
# Define voice commands and responses
# Listen for user command
# Convert speech to text
# Process user command and generate response

engine = pyttsx3.init()

commands = {
    'hello': 'Hello! How can I assist you?',
    'what is your name': 'My name is Assistant.',
    'how is the weather': 'Sorry, I am not connected to the internet.',
    'stop': 'Goodbye! Have a nice day.'
}

# Listen for user command
while True:
    try:
        with sr.Microphone() as source:
            print("Listening...")
            r.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
            audio = r.listen(source)

        # Convert speech to text
        text = r.recognize_google(audio)
        print("User Command:", text)

        # Process user command and generate response
        for command, response in commands.items():
            if command in text.lower():
                print("Assistant:", response)
                engine.say(response)
                engine.runAndWait()
                break
        else:
            print("Assistant: Sorry, I didn't understand.")

    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Assistant: Sorry, I didn't catch that. Please try again.")
    
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print("Assistant: An error occurred during speech recognition:", str(e))
